To those who say this on overseas bulletin boards 

Japanese people never thought of Yasuke as a samurai to begin with. 

Japanese people didn't care because anime and games are fiction. 

I'm surprised that there are people who really believe that there were black samurai. 

I thought that only small children couldn't distinguish between fiction and reality. 

Thomas Lockley's book is fiction. 

He himself said it. 

It would be interesting if it was like this. 

It's his delusion. 

There are only five short passages about Yasuke in Japan. 

There is nothing in them that indicates that he was a samurai. 

The most important thing is that there is no samurai without a surname in the history of Japan. 

His name is not on any list of samurai left in Japan. 

The complex of being discriminated against prevents us from seeing reality. 

Japanese people like black people and black music, but they get really angry when people use their imagination to portray their race as having played an important role in Japanese history, or when people call Japanese people racists."

Nobunaga promoted those who were competent, but even that took years. I think black samurai are interesting as fiction, but I can't forgive fabricated history being spread as the truth.

There's more to this story. Ironically, when he published Yasuke's book in Japan in 2017 (two years before 「AFRICAN SAMURAI」), he hired a translator because he did not understand Japanese.
All of the books he has published are listed as ""not peer-reviewed"" on his university's website.

The BBC article stated, ""Some researchers believe Yasuke may have been a slave, but there is no proof,"" which is incorrect.
The term ""slave"" is clearly mentioned in the historical documents of the Society of Jesus.
I know there is also an article about Yasuke on CNN.

However, there is something odd about the four seasons existing simultaneously on the screen.

Rice planting is out of season at the same time as cherry blossoms blooming in early spring, and there are even plants that only exist in autumn, so I thought it was a comedy and laughed.

In addition, in Japan, ""torii"" serves as a barrier that separates the sacred area of ​​shrines and the secular world where humans live, and indicates the entrance to the sacred area.

It is a kind of sacred ""gate"".

Only those who have visited shrines dedicated to famous ancient gods in Japan will understand, but

if you enter the sacred area with a sacred feeling, a pure aura is transmitted and the surrounding atmosphere changes instantly.

So the way they treat ""torii"" like a village gate is laughable.

Also, the main character is a former slave named ""Yasuke"" who certainly existed in Japan, but he did not hold the rank of samurai, and was just a whim of Oda Nobunaga to take a liking to him and serve him until he was assassinated, so he is an unknown person who was not well known in Japan until recently.

Because if he was even slightly recognized and active in Japan, there would be no way that there wouldn't be a stone monument or some document left behind.

It's also unlikely that he was given armor.

You claim that ""this is just a historical novel"" and ""just because it's Japanese culture, there's no need to get into the details."" 
But I can't stand it anymore when people from other countries recognize ""this is Japan"" as ""a strange Japan that any Japanese person, even a child, feels uncomfortable about."" 
There are an increasing number of people who believe in ""simple historical novels"" that are too strange, and the white man's story of guiding the Japanese is being widely spread. 
""Yasuke"" was a slave who became a page and servant of Nobunaga, and after the Honnoji Incident, he was not killed by Akechi Mitsuhide because he was not a samurai, but was handed over to Portuguese missionaries. This is the truth that can be read from each ancient document. 
If ""Yasuke"" was a ninja on Nobunaga's side and was active in the shadows, I would enjoy the game with great joy. 
In Disney's ""Shogun,"" one of the producers was a Japanese man named Sanada, and the actors were also Japanese actors, and the props, gestures, and script were all Japanese, so it became a real Japanese period drama. The anime series ""The Apothecary Diaries"" has started, and it's a Japanese anime about a fictional country set in ancient China. 
It seems to be very popular with Chinese people because it's not a stereotype, but a completely Chinese-style anime. 
Chinese people who have watched it have said that the anime has ""Tang-era costumes, Ming and Qing-era technology, but the main story is fictional. The buildings are from the Forbidden City of the Ming and Qing dynasties, and some of the officials' names are from Tang-era poets, so the overall feel is that of the Ming dynasty."" 
I hope Assassin's Creed Shadows will do something on the level of ""The Apothecary Diaries."" If they're spending money on it, then..."

When a samurai commits seppuku. Although they may cut off the head as a form of kaishaku to shorten the suffering, in a melee or when it is unclear how many enemies there are, there is no time to cut off the head every time.

Don't lie, selling the wrong Japanese culture is not acceptable.

When praying at a temple, you only pray with your hands together.

It is the Europeans who should be avenged, and the Japanese have nothing to do with it. Game director Charles Benoit says that the reason he made Yasuke one of the main characters was because matchlock guns, which had an impact on Japan's transformation period, were brought to Japan from Portugal, and an outside perspective on Japan was necessary. In other words, he is trying to say that Japan evolved because the Western technology was brought to Japan, which had an inferior culture. Moreover, he thinks that there is no problem in making a human being the main character because Japanese people are so weak that even a human who was enslaved by white people can rival a samurai with a short period of training.

Something I think would be cool is after ezio sleeps with Christiana and her father walks in the next day to see him in her bed, have him be chased by the gaurds like the OG but have him cornered on a rooftop with nothing but a hay bale to jump into. Its either a death or death situation so ezio jumps and actually survives even to his own astonishment.

In the first place, walking around town in armor with a family crest is not a battlefield, so perhaps they wanted to portray Yasuke as just a bandit or barbarian? 
It's impossible to have a torii gate with tiles on it in front of a village, I don't understand why he's wearing a hat like in Southeast Asia, and the kimono is Chinese style, not Japanese, so I'm actually impressed that almost everything is so bad. 
It's 2024, but it feels like I'm watching a work from the 80s.

"the combat as Yasuke seems Janky and not smooth, mainly based on abilites and not combos that actually require the player to learn the mechanics and get better at the game, but simply to just level up, like in other rpg types AC games. Naoe on the other hand looks like a return to OG assasin&#39;s creed vibes, which is good, and there&#39;s a heavy emphasis on AC stealth with new weapons and mechanics and fast smooth parkour which is very refreshing. In my opinion for the samurai part of the game, i think no samurai game can hope to beat Ghost of Tsushima&#39;s non stealth combat, there was smoothness, and the ability to change targets flawlessly, plus its a bit weird for yasuke to stick out like a sore thumb in a crowd in an AC game with how tall he is and everyone bowing to him left and right, in  an AC game in which you litterally have to blend in with the crowd, but i get it he&#39;s a samurai lord.","the combat as Yasuke seems Janky and not smooth, mainly based on abilites and not combos that actually require the player to learn the mechanics and get better at the game, but simply to just level up, like in other rpg types AC games.

"I appreciate the new stylistic direction brought to Assassin’s Creed: Shadows. While I’m not complaining, I can&#39;t help but notice that Ghost of Tsushima exhibited remarkably smooth physics, especially in walking, running, jumping, and, most notably, combat. In comparison, the movement physics in Shadows occasionally feel stiff and less fluid. I hope the developers can address this by the final release. Ultimately, it’s not just about graphics or new mechanics; it’s the physics and story that truly elevate the gameplay experience.","I appreciate the new stylistic direction brought to Assassin’s Creed: Shadows.

Isn't this a matter of the level of alteration? For example, if Yasuke appeared in this game and gave the protagonist some of Oda Nobunaga's belongings, he wouldn't be so angry. If they really wanted Yasuke to appear, they should have him play a role that was appropriate to his original position.

Assassin's Creed pre-orders are currently in 21st place. Dragon Quest, which will be released in the same month of November, is in 1st place. 

The majority of Japanese people are either not interested in Assassin's Creed or are angry rather than excited. 

All of the few records about Yasuke prove that he was not a samurai. 

However, UBI lies by saying that Yasuke is an African samurai who has been passed down through history. 

The majority of Japanese people are unaware of his existence, and those who do know about him only believe that ""Nobunaga had him carry luggage as a spectacle because it was so unusual."" 

UBI portrays Japanese culture without doing any research, and in Japan there are a lot of critical comments and videos. 

Please understand. 

Search for ""Assassin's Creed"" on YouTube and try translating the comments."

It's wrong to say Yasuke is historical fact when there is no record of him being a samurai. 
If they were touting it as a Japanese fantasy, it wouldn't be such a fuss. 

Black samurai → Maybe they're cool 

Black samurai who existed in historical fact → There is no such thing. Stop lying

The game creator announced that ""there were black samurai in old Japan."" 
Japan at that time was a class society. 
This is like saying that there were black people in the aristocracy of England at that time. 
If they had announced that the main character was modeled after Yasuke, a black man who existed in old Japan, there would have been no problem. 

Nioh was announced as a character modeled after Yasuke, so there was no problem. 
Therefore, although you may not know it in English, in Japanese it is written in katakana as ""Yasuke."" 
The explanation just says that the name of a person who appears in historical fact is used. 
Nowhere does it say that Yasuke, who existed in old Japan, was a black samurai. 
And Nioh is a Japanese-style fantasy. It's a different genre."

佐賀藩藩士の子孫より",@xxxkidzooxxx,7,2024-06-18 10:43:59+00:00,2024-06-18,"The following is the original Japanese text before translation. 

My ancestor died in the Bunroku-Keicho War, but his lord regretted his outstanding bravery and ordered him to take one of three excellent brothers from another family as a son-in-law so that the family name would not be cut off, and the family name has continued to this day. 

In other words, if a samurai was truly brave, proper records and oral traditions would have been passed down in detail to the present day. Also, family names are extremely important to samurai. 

My ancestor who died in battle was a contemporary of Yasuke. 
In a game series that claims to be faithful to historical facts, this protagonist setting is an insult to the real samurai who lived in that era and fought and died hard. 
Have you forgotten that there are descendants of him who are proud and value honor who still exist in Japan today? 
Is a man with no family name, no will to sacrifice himself for his lord, and who surrenders by handing his sword to the enemy a famous samurai? 
I am against cultural appropriation and the fabrication and alteration of history. 

Don't make fun of the Japanese. 

From a descendant of a Saga domain samurai"

It is true that Yasuke existed.

·They don't hunt heads except for those of generals. It doesn't count as a feat

Even if they are criminals, they don't damage the body too much

·They don't stab the kneeling victim

(To avoid damaging the body more than necessary)

Even if it is a general's head, if it is confirmed as a feat, it is memorialized and returned to the family, if they refuse, it is buried in a grave

They rarely carry iron clubs, and that alone scares the generals

(Samurai generally carried swords, bows, and spears)

He was only given a room in the house of Nobunaga's subordinate.

Also, there were slaves in Japan before Hideyoshi banned randori (there was a ban before Hideyoshi but it wasn't followed), so I think some of the people in Nobunaga's era were slaves. Also, it seems that the book about the short sword and private home was written in a copy of some copy in the home of a descendant, but no one has been able to confirm it. I was watching a talk on the English Wikipedia and it said that a European ordered the book online to check it out. In the end, it's a copy of a copy written by someone in later generations, so I don't think it's a first-class historical document. But the sword Yasuke received was the shortest, so it was probably for self-defense. Before Hideyoshi's sword hunt, everyone had weapons normally. Also, private homes aren't particularly luxurious. There aren't many Japanese people who want to live in the same house as a foreigner (especially a missionary slave) who isn't a native Japanese speaker, so it's not surprising that they were given a separate house. The most logical explanation is that the ownership of the missionary slaves was simply transferred to Nobunaga, and they served him as slaves."

Japan at that time was an anarchic time, when farmers and townspeople alike were willing to take up arms and fight. 
If there were no weapons, people would often resist by throwing stones in groups. 
It was an era of overthrowing the ruling class, so even if the opponent was wearing armor, if there was only one person, they would be wary but not respectful. 
Well, they would pretend to bow their heads to avoid any trouble. 
It was an era when farmers, townspeople, monks, and priests would fight with weapons in their hands and protect themselves if necessary. 
If farmers, townspeople, monks, and priests were neglected, they would take up arms and rise up, so it was an era when the samurai class could not do anything unreasonable. They even had to be appeased. 
Even in such an era, there was a certain degree of order because the overwhelming majority of people believed in Shinto and Buddhism. The kind of outrageous behavior that Yasuke exhibited would not be tolerated in the city during the day. 
Comparing all the ancient documents that remain in Japan, Yasuke did not have a surname (family name). Therefore, Yasuke was not an aristocratic samurai, but rather a maid or servant. 
In short, Yasuke was on the same level as farmers and townspeople. 
Feudal lords would not tolerate the outrageous behavior of their subordinate samurai. They could only do so if they had the farmers, townspeople, monks, and priests on their side. 
The Sengoku period, unlike the Tokugawa period, did not have a rigid class system."

Why do you think Japanese people were involved in the performance, direction, and script of ""Shogun"" - the actors, props, costumes, and mannerisms? 
Because I'm sick of things that aren't Japanese being made to be Japanese, and people who are different from the historical facts being portrayed as if they were big shots. What's more, I'm sick of stories about white people leading the Japanese in the right direction. 
According to ancient documents, ""Yasuke"" started out as a slave and became Nobunaga's page and servant, and after the Honnoji Incident, he wasn't killed because he wasn't a samurai, but was handed over to Portuguese missionaries. This is mostly true. 
I would have enjoyed it greatly if ""Yasuke"" had become a ninja on Nobunaga's side and played a major role in the darkness.

Almost all Japanese people study history and culture, so they resist the spread of incorrect information about Japanese culture. 
You're making your comments in English, but where did you learn about Japanese history? In order to learn Japanese history properly, Japanese literature is essential, so why don't you comment in Japanese?

"​@@GenMackerelMan, let&#39;s take a step back here.  First off, you can dislike GoT, no issues there, but to say a game is overrated is, to quote The Dude, just like, your opinion, man.  But on a more serious note, GoT is set in 12th Century Japan, AC Shadows is set in the 16th century, literally 400 years later, so yeah, there better be a more fleshed out community in AC Shadows, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that&#39;s partly why they chose the time period.  With that said, GoT game world is meant to feel less fleshed out, or &quot;empty&quot; as you put it.  It doesn&#39;t make sense for a game set in the 12th century to have a town or city over every hill or be filled in with a mass amount of population and community, it&#39;s going to be spread out and it&#39;s going to be tiny villages, pretty much how SuckerPunch designed the world because they spent years researching the culture, community, and landscape of that time period.  In that sense, it&#39;s not empty, it&#39;s fairly realistic.  AC Shadows may very well be just as authentic to the 16th century as GoT was to the 12th century, and that may be more up your alley, totally fine, just don&#39;t go bashing a game for being the way the developers intended it to be simply because it wasn&#39;t what you &quot;wanted&quot; it to be.  That&#39;s not overrated, that just wasn&#39;t your cup of tea and you&#39;re allowed that, but it doesn&#39;t make it a bad game.
